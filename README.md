## üåü Featured Projects

### Ethereum Network Identifier

A lightweight Go tool for identifying which Ethereum network a node is operating on by performing P2P protocol handshakes. Implements the complete Ethereum P2P protocol handshake sequence to determine if a node belongs to Mainnet, Sepolia, Holesky, or other networks.

**Key Features:**
- Implements complete Ethereum P2P protocol handshake sequence
- Supports all major Ethereum networks (Mainnet, Sepolia, Holesky, etc.)
- Handles protocol negotiation with nodes supporting multiple versions
- Provides detailed connection and handshake information
